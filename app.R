# Recount Explorer: browse the recount3 catalog of uniformly processed RNA-seq
# studies and visualize any of them without writing code.
#
# App layer: page layout and module wiring only. Computation lives in
# R/logic_*.R, which is Shiny-free and testable on its own. Each view is a
# module in R/mod_*.R. The single data contract between modules is the `study`
# reactive the browser module returns:
# list(project, organism, source, rse, log_expr), NULL until a study loads.
#
# The interface is bslib. An R contributor can change any part of it without a
# JavaScript toolchain, which is the whole reason it is bslib.
